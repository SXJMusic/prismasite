## 1. Purpose

This Agreement covers the creation, deployment, and maintenance of a simple mobile-friendly HTML/CSS/JavaScript portfolio website hosted on Cloudflare Pages with automated deployment from GitHub. It also defines the revenue share associated with sales made through this version of the Site.

### 1.1 Intent of the Website

The intended function of the Site is to provide the Client with:

* A public portfolio showcasing artistic work.
* A soft web store used to market and sell **artist design services**, including but not limited to:
  * Cover art design  
  * Promotional video production  
  * Music video storyboarding  
  * Graphic and visual design services  
  * Related artist-based creative services
* A clean landing-page experience for social media profiles (Instagram, X/Twitter, TikTok, YouTube, etc.), including:
  * Service descriptions  
  * Cover art samples  
  * Direct outbound links to all social media and external platforms  
  * Link-in-bio–optimized layout

This Agreement applies **only** to this version of the Site. Any expansion beyond this intent (such as full e-commerce, subscription systems, or advanced interactive features) requires a new or revised agreement.

---

## 2. Scope of Work

Service Provider will design, build, and deploy a lightweight portfolio website consisting of:

* Mobile-first HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
* Portfolio layout and media showcase
* Landing page optimized for social media integration and link-in-bio use
* Outbound links to Client social media accounts and external stores
* Integrated service inquiry or purchase flow (Google Forms, Stripe Checkout links, or both)
* Optional storefront-style sections for design services
* Basic payment link integration (non-custom)
* Light UX adjustments and ongoing minor updates

This is a minimal, static deployment intended for speed, reliability, and ease of maintenance.

### 2.1 Technical Stack

The Site will be built using:

* **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
* **Cloudflare Pages** (hosting, SSL, caching, CDN)
* **GitHub** (repository + automated deployments)
* **Google Forms** (for service inquiries/intake)
* **Payment Processor:** Stripe or PayPal  
  * Stripe recommended for SKU, tax, and accounting simplicity
* **Optional Alternative:** Gumroad or similar (provided by Client)

### 2.2 Social Media & External Integration

The Service Provider will implement:

* Outbound social media links  
* Link-card sections if requested  
* Service summaries optimized for mobile  
* Display of recent cover art or highlight works  
* Clean navigation for users coming from bios or social platforms  

This ensures the Site can serve as the Client’s central online hub.

### 2.3 Repository & Version Control

* Code will be stored in a **GitHub repository** owned by the Client (or jointly, if preferred).
* Cloudflare Pages will automatically build and deploy on each push to the designated branch.
* The repository is strictly for this version of the Site unless otherwise agreed.


### 2.4 Design Revisions and Iteration

The website design will be developed collaboratively based on the Client's needs and feedback. The Service Provider will offer reasonable revisions during the development phase prior to launch.

A “revision” is defined as a request to modify existing content, layout, styling, or visual elements that fall within the scope of the initial portfolio and landing-page design.

Revisions are included up until a formal **Launch Approval** or **Design Sign-Off**, whichever comes first. Once the Client provides written approval (email, message, or signature), the design is considered finalized.

Any redesigns, new page requests, major layout changes, or feature additions requested *after* the sign-off point will be treated as out-of-scope and may require a separate agreement or additional fees.

(I'm expecting us to have to do some changes and tweaks after launch to solve for usability and other related concerns - this clause is more related to a situation like scrapping what we've built and starting over from scratch, or adding a whole new section or feature set that wasn't part of the original plan. I'm aware the design isn't quite baked yet, so this is just to clarify the process moving forward after we've settled on something.)

## 3. Revenue Share

Client agrees to pay the Service Provider a **10% revenue share** on all sales generated through this Site.

### 3.1 Payment Structure

Payments may be handled in either of these formats:

1. **Platform-Integrated Splitting**
   * If Stripe or a similar platform supports automatic fee splitting, 10% is routed directly to the Service Provider.

2. **Manual Weekly Payouts**
   * If automatic splitting is unavailable, the Client will remit 10% of **net sales** each week.

### 3.2 Net Sales Definition

Net sales = gross sales collected **minus**:

* Payment processor fees  
* Refunds  
* Chargebacks  

### 3.3 Transparency

To maintain accuracy, Client will:

* Provide view-only access to Stripe, PayPal, or Gumroad dashboards, **or**
* Send weekly exported sales summaries

## 4. Ownership and Rights

### 4.1 Content Ownership

* Client owns all artwork, graphics, branding, and written content they provide.
* Service Provider owns custom code, templates, and technical configurations.

Client receives a **perpetual, non-exclusive license** to use the delivered website assets.

### 4.2 Future Scaling

If the Client later requires functionality beyond the scope of this project, such as:

* A full e-commerce store  
* Subscriptions or memberships  
* Shopping cart system  
* Digital product delivery  
* Authentication or dashboards  
* Custom backend or Workers API  
* Major redesign or rebrand  
* New pages or expanded sections  
* Migration to a different tech stack  

—these enhancements must be covered under a **new or amended agreement** with updated pricing and scope.

## 7. Term & Termination

* Upon termination, the Client may continue using the delivered Site; revenue share applies only while this Agreement remains active.

* Sales performance  
* Third-party outages (Cloudflare, GitHub, Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
